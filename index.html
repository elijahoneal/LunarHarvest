                <p>Lunar Harvest is an idea that began to take shape in 2018. I had moved to Orlando, FL a year earlier and had aspirations of becoming a graphic designer. However, by mid 2018 I still had not made much progress on that career path. I started to wonder if there was something else that I was meant to do. Around that same time, I had been watching alot of gardening/ farming videos which led me to try my hand at it. I had a small porch area that I used to grow plants. The first plant I grew was a marigold I got from a market in Jacksonville, and I enjoyed nurturing and watching it grow. Next I tried a tomato plant which was a failure the first try. After watching more videos I realized what I had done wrong and tried again. This time was a success! After a few weeks beautiful fruits started to grow from the thick vine. From that moment on I was hooked and decided on a new career path. One that would see organic nutrient dense food on peoples tables. I moved back to Jacksonville in May of 2019 and made preparations to start in earnest. The rest is history.</p>
